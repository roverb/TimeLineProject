Why are there som many props and items we see in the show that are all connected to the 19's? The song "Where everybody knows your name" is even featured in the show. my explanation for this is a Great Dimension Split.

This event destroyed pretty much all life in The Land of OOO.
A couple of humans escaped the nuclear explosion and fled to the sewer and other underground habits.
Susan Strong and her people might be a couple of these survivors.
The creatures and humans that didn't get away were killed by the blast, radiation, the Lich or were mutated in new creatures like the candy people.
Most of the other inhabitant of The Land of OOO come from different dimensions.
Marcaline is born a couple of years before the disaster and meets Simon Petrikov a couple of hours after the destruction, as there is still smoke and fire in the air.
She probably didn't die because of her being a Vampire already or having immortality from her father.

This war probably occured several years after the GMW (Great Mushroom War).
It has been stated that the Rainicorns and Dogs fought over territory in the Crystal Dimension.
This could be doubted because on the drawing made by Jake smooth hills can be seen.
These cannot be found in the Crystal Dimension.
The Adventure Time wiki states that the Ranicorns are from The Candy Kingdom or The Crystal Dimension.

       At some point after the GMW people from other dimensions (Crystal Dimension, Nightosphere) come to Earth that is know a little safer to live on. The reason for this migration is unknown, maybe disaster and wars like the GMW are involved. The people from these dimension settled on the earth and created new kingdoms (Fire Kingdom etc.), the kingdoms we now know today.

       About our candy princess we know she is 18. Take 3043 (The year the show takes place) take away 18 and there you have it, 3025. She probably is a mutated human, sort of a human-candy crossbreed. The candy people are probably evolved from the goo-like candy creatures (as seen in "Simon & Marcy"). So did she. Jake refers to her as "a horrible mutant mix of bubblegum and human DNA".

        Finn turns 13 in the episode "The Mystery Train". The show takes place in the year 3043 (calculations!), take away 13 years and there you have it. We know very little about Finn's origin. What we do know is that at the age of 3 maybe 4, he was found on boom boom mountain by Jake's parents, he was adopted and raised by them. In the secondary universe (The Farmland), we get to know more about him. We see his mother and his donkey/horse.
